# Legacy System Cleanup Log

This document records all files and systems removed during the migration from the complex Supabase/static hybrid system to the clean Sanity + Netlify + DeepL architecture.

## Migration Date
**Completed:** [Date to be filled when cleanup is done]

## Architecture Change Summary

### FROM (Removed)
- **Database**: Supabase with complex translation tables
- **Generation**: Static HTML generation from JSON/Supabase
- **Translation**: Complex regex manipulation and caching
- **Admin**: Multiple fragmented admin interfaces
- **Image Handling**: Duplication workarounds and complex mappings

### TO (New Clean Architecture)
- **Database**: Sanity CMS with field-level translations
- **Generation**: Direct GROQ queries from public pages
- **Translation**: Automatic DeepL translation on save
- **Admin**: Simple HTML forms with Netlify Functions
- **Image Handling**: Direct Sanity Assets integration

## Files Removed

### Supabase Database Functions
```bash
# Netlify Functions (Supabase-based)
netlify/functions/process-installation.js
netlify/functions/process-installation-v2.js
netlify/functions/process-installation-final.js
netlify/functions/process-installation-simple.js
netlify/functions/get-installations.js
netlify/functions/get-installations-public.js
netlify/functions/delete-installation.js
netlify/functions/update-installation.js
netlify/functions/regenerate-installation-pages.js
netlify/functions/regenerate-installation-pages-v2.js
netlify/functions/debug-supabase.js
netlify/functions/debug-public-installations.js
netlify/functions/test-supabase.js
netlify/functions/simple-upload-test.js
```

**Rationale**: These functions were built around Supabase schema and complex translation workflows. The new architecture uses simpler functions with Sanity.

### Static Generation Scripts
```bash
# Generation Scripts
generate-installation-pages-supabase.cjs
generate-installation-pages-multilingual.cjs
generate-translated-installation-pages.cjs
generate-translated-installation-pages.js
generate-main-pages-multilingual.js
update-installation-pages.js
update-installations-page-from-sanity.js
auto-generate-installation-page.js
generate-installations-from-sanity.js
```

**Rationale**: Static generation is no longer needed. Public pages query Sanity directly via JavaScript.

### Migration and Data Processing Scripts
```bash
# Migration Scripts
migrate-to-supabase.js
migrate-supabase-to-sanity.js
comprehensive-supabase-to-sanity-migration.js
migrate-images-to-sanity.js
migrate-images-to-supabase.cjs

# Data Processing
batch-translate-installations.cjs
batch-translate-installations.js
bulk-translate-installations.js
apply-translation-schema.js
apply-migrations.cjs
update-supabase-installations.cjs
fix-installation-images.js
fix-image-mappings.js
smart-image-migration.js
ultra-aggressive-migration.js
```

**Rationale**: These were one-time migration scripts that are no longer needed. Translation now happens automatically on save.

### Analysis and Debug Scripts
```bash
# Analysis Scripts
analyze-image-migration.cjs
analyze-companies.cjs
analyze-url-structure.cjs
check-image-formats.cjs
check-thanks.cjs
clean-broken-links-supabase.cjs
debug-images.js
verify-table-structure.js
test-supabase.js
test-supabase-optimization.js
optimize-supabase-images.js

# Update Scripts
update-customer-links-supabase.cjs
update-html-images.js
fix-customer-links-supabase.cjs
clean-broken-links-supabase.cjs
```

**Rationale**: These were debugging tools for the complex Supabase system. Sanity's simpler architecture doesn't require such debugging.

### Translation System Files
```bash
# Translation Scripts
add-missing-translations.cjs
find-missing-translations.cjs
batch-translate-installations.js
generate-translated-installation-pages.js
update-installation-translations.js
fix-published-locales.js

# Translation Data Files
translation-results.json
missing-translations.json
```

**Rationale**: Complex translation workflows replaced by automatic DeepL translation on save.

### Legacy Admin Files
```bash
# Old Admin Pages
admin/add-installation-v2.html (kept current add-installation.html)
admin/manage-installations.html (replaced with installations.html)
admin/bulk-translate.html
admin/translations.html

# Sanity Studio Pages (partial implementation)
admin/sanity/add-images-existing-schema.html
admin/sanity/add-images.html
admin/sanity/add-installation.html
admin/sanity/debug-current-data.html
admin/sanity/debug-image-data.html
admin/sanity/debug.html
admin/sanity/index.html
admin/sanity/manage-installations.html
admin/sanity/migrate-from-local-files.html
admin/sanity/migrate-images.html
admin/sanity/test-image-fields.html
admin/sanity/test.html
admin/sanity/translations.html
admin/sanity/verify-updates.html
admin/sanity/js/complete-image-mapping.js
admin/sanity/js/form-validation.js
admin/sanity/js/image-upload.js
admin/sanity/js/sanity-client.js
```

**Rationale**: The old admin interfaces were built for the Supabase system. Partial Sanity Studio implementation is replaced by clean HTML forms.

### Client-side Supabase Integration
```bash
# Client Libraries
js/supabase-client.js
js/installation-page-loader.js
```

**Rationale**: Replaced by the new `js/sanity-client.js` which handles GROQ queries.

### Data Files and Caches
```bash
# Data Files
installations.json (original backup - keep as reference)
asset-cache.json
image-mapping-complete.json
image-migration-analysis.json
image-migration-results.json
installations-analysis.json
installations-backup.json
supabase-update-results.json

# URL and Migration Results
url-standardization-plan.json
migration-results-*.json
```

**Rationale**: These were intermediate data files from various migration attempts. No longer needed with clean Sanity architecture.

### Configuration Files
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
supabase-setup.sql
supabase-translation-schema.sql
supabase-translation-schema-fixed.sql
add-thanks-to-fields.sql
fix-rls-policies.sql
fix-translation-logs-rls.sql
fix-translation-logs.sql
```

**Rationale**: Supabase database configuration no longer needed.

### Test and Optimization Files
```bash
# Test Files
test-multilingual-installations.cjs
test-sanity-image-update.js
test-single-update.js
test-translation.js
test-update-function.html

# Image Optimization
build-complete-image-mapping.js
cleanup-picture-elements.js
extract-installation-images.js
optimization-summary.js
optimize-images.js
```

**Rationale**: These were specific to the old system's complexity. New system is simpler and doesn't need such tools.

## Dependencies Removed

### Package.json Dependencies (to be removed)
```bash
# Supabase
@supabase/supabase-js

# Complex processing (may still need some for Functions)
# Review these carefully:
# - formidable (still needed for file uploads)
# - @sanity/client (now needed for new system)
```

### Environment Variables (to be removed from Netlify)
```bash
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

## Files Kept (Important)

### Reference Data
```bash
installations.json  # Original data source - keep as backup reference
```

### New Architecture Files
```bash
# New Sanity Schema
sanity/schemas/installation.js

# New Netlify Functions
netlify/functions/upload-image.js
netlify/functions/installations-upsert.js
netlify/functions/installations-list.js
netlify/functions/installations-get.js
netlify/functions/_utils/auth.js

# New Admin Interface
admin/login.html
admin/add-installation.html
admin/edit-installation.html
admin/installations.html
admin/index.html
admin/css/admin.css
admin/js/auth.js
admin/js/admin-common.js

# New Client Library
js/sanity-client.js

# Configuration
ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md
netlify.toml (updated for new functions)
```
