# Glooloop Mixer Deployment Instructions

## Deployment Folder Ready

The `glooloop-mixer` folder contains the production-ready build of the Rosehill TPVÂ® Colour Mixer for Glooloop.

## How to Deploy to Your TPV Netlify Site

1. **Copy the folder**: Copy the entire `glooloop-mixer` folder to the root of your TPV repository (where your index.html is located)

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add glooloop-mixer
   git commit -m "Add Glooloop colour mixer tool"
   git push
   ```

3. **Access the mixer**: Once deployed, the mixer will be available at:
   ```
   https://your-tpv-site.netlify.app/glooloop-mixer/
   ```

## Folder Contents

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
