**Two Main Modes:**
1. **Playground Design** - Create artistic patterns and themes (ocean, jungle, space, etc.)
2. **Sports Surface Design** - Design courts, tracks, and combine them with playground artwork

## Understanding Colour Modes

Your design can use colours in two ways:

### Solid Mode (Simple)
- Uses only the 21 standard TPV colours
- Each area is ONE pure colour
- Easier to manufacture
- Lower cost

### Blend Mode (Custom)
- Mix TPV granules to create custom colours
- Better colour accuracy
- The system calculates exact mixing recipes
- More options, slightly more complex

**Switching Between Modes:**
Click the "Solid" or "Blend" toggle buttons above your design.

---

## Editing Colours

Want to change a colour in your design?

1. **Look at the Colour Legend** on the right side
   - Shows all colours used
   - Displays what percentage each colour covers

2. **Click on any colour** to edit it

3. **Choose a new colour:**
   - In **Solid Mode**: Pick from the 21 TPV colour swatches
   - In **Blend Mode**: Use the colour picker for any shade

4. **Make areas transparent:**
   - Click "Make Transparent" to remove colour from an area
   - The background will show through

5. **Changes appear instantly** on your design

### The 21 Standard TPV Colours

| Colour Family | Available Shades |
|---------------|------------------|
| Reds | Standard Red, Bright Red |
| Greens | Standard, Bright, Dark |
| Blues | Standard, Light, Azure, Turquoise, Purple |

## Blend Recipes (Blend Mode Only)

When using custom colours, the system calculates exactly how to mix TPV granules.

**What you'll see:**
- The TPV colour codes (e.g., "RH10", "RH20")
- Mixing ratios (e.g., "3 parts Green + 1 part Blue")
- The resulting blend colour

**Why this matters:**
Manufacturers use these recipes to create your exact colours on the playground surface.

1. **Click "In-Situ Preview"**
2. **Upload a photo** of the playground location

## Common Questions

- Try a simpler description
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page and try again

### "Colours look different in Solid vs Blend mode"
- This is normal! Solid mode uses the nearest pure TPV colour
- Blend mode shows the actual mixed colour

### "I can't find my saved design"
- Use the search box in "My Designs"
- Check if it's in a different project folder

### "Export is taking a long time"
- Large designs take longer to process
- PDF exports may take 10-30 seconds
- The file will download automatically when ready

## Design Tips

1. **Start simple** - You can always add more detail later
2. **Use 3-5 colours** - More economical and often looks better
3. **Check coverage percentages** - Higher coverage = more material needed
4. **Save often** - Keep versions of your work
5. **Test on-site preview** - Shows clients exactly what they'll get
